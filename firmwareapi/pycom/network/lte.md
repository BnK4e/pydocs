# LTE

The LTE class provides access to the LTE-M/NB-IoT modem on the GPy and FiPy. LTE-M/NB-IoT are new categories of cellular protocols developed by the [3GPP](http://www.3gpp.org) and optimised for long battery life power and longer range. These are new protocols currently in the process of being deployed by mobile networks across the world.

The GPy and FiPy support both new LTE-M protocols:

* **Cat-M1**: also known as **LTE-M** defines a 1.4 MHz radio channel size and about 375 kbps of throughput. It is optimised for coverage and long battery life, outperforming 2G/GPRS, while being similar to previous LTE standards.
* **Cat-NB1** also known as **NB-IoT**, defines a 200 kHz radio channel size and around 60 kbps of uplink speed. It's optimised for ultra low throughput and specifically designed for IoT devices with a very long battery life. NB-IoT shares some features with LTE such as operating in licensed spectrum, but it's a very different protocol. It should be noted that NB-IoT has many restrictions as does not offer full IP connectivity and does not support mobility. When moving between cells, you will need to reconnect.

**Please note:** The GPy and FiPy only support the two protocols above and are not compatible with older LTE standards.

The Sequans modem used on Pycom's cellular enabled modules can only work in one of these modes at a time. In order to switch between the two protocols you need to flash a different firmware to the Sequans modem. Instructions for this can be found [here](../../../tutorials/lte/firmware.md).

## AT Commands

The AT commands for the Sequans Monarch modem on the GPy/FiPy are available in a PDF file.

## Constructors

#### class network.LTE\(id=0, ...\)

Create and configure a LTE object. See init for params of configuration.

```python
from network import LTE
lte = LTE()
```

## Methods

#### lte.init\(\*, carrier=None\)

This method is used to set up the LTE subsystem. After a `deinit()` this method can take several seconds to return waiting for the LTE modem to start-up. Optionally specify a carrier name. The available options are: `verizon, at&t, standard`. `standard` is generic for any carrier, and it's also the option used when no arguments are given.

#### lte.deinit\(\*, deattach=False\)

Disables LTE modem completely. This reduces the power consumption to the minimum. Call this before entering deepsleep.

Has one optional parameter

1. `lte.deinit(dettach=False)`  allows the modem to go into deep sleep (PSM, eDRX) without dettaching from the network

#### lte.attach\(\*,apn=None, band=None\)

Enable radio functionality and attach to the LTE Cat M1 network authorised by the inserted SIM card. Optionally specify the band to scan for networks. If no band \(or `None`\) is specified, all 6 bands will be scanned. The possible values for the band are: `3, 4, 12, 13, 20 and 28`.

You can also specify an APN during the call to attach

```python
    lte.attach(apn="nb.inetd.gdsp")
```

#### lte.isattached\(\)

Returns `True` if the cellular mode is attached to the network. `False` otherwise.

#### lte.dettach\(reset=True\)

Detach the modem from the LTE Cat M1 and disable the radio functionality.
Has one optional parameter:

1. `lte.deinit(reset=True)`  will reset the modem before going into causing it to go into deep sleep.    

#### lte.connect\(\*, cid=1\)

Start a data session and obtain and IP address. Optionally specify a CID \(Connection ID\) for the data session. The arguments are:

* `cid` is a Connection ID. This is carrier specific, for Verizon use `cid=3`. For others like Telstra it should be `cid=1`.

For instance, to attach and connect to Verizon:

```python
import time
from network import LTE

lte = LTE(carrier="verizon")
lte.attach(band=13)

while not lte.isattached():
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print('Attaching...')

lte.connect(cid=3)
while not lte.isconnected():
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print('Connecting...')

# Now use sockets as usual...
```

#### lte.isconnected\(\)

Returns `True` if there is an active LTE data session and IP address has been obtained. `False` otherwise.

#### lte.disconnect\(\)

End the data session with the network.

#### lte.send\_at\_cmd\(cmd, delay=1000\)

Send an AT command directly to the modem. Returns the raw response from the modem as a string object. **IMPORTANT:** If a data session is active \(i.e. the modem is _connected_\), sending the AT commands requires to pause and then resume the data session. this can be done with the pppsuspend() and pppresume() methods.

Has an optional delay paramter to specify the number of milliseconds the esp32 chip will wait between sending an AT command to the modem. and reading the response.

Example:

```python
lte.send_at_cmd('AT+CEREG?')    # check for network registration manually (sames as lte.isattached())
```

Optionally the response can be parsed for pretty printing:

```python
def send_at_cmd_pretty(cmd):
    response = lte.send_at_cmd(cmd).split('\r\n')
    for line in response:
        print(line)

send_at_cmd_pretty('AT!="showphy"')     # get the PHY status
send_at_cmd_pretty('AT!="fsm"')         # get the System FSM
```

#### lte.imei\(\)

Returns a string object with the IMEI number of the LTE modem.

#### lte.iccid\(\)

Returns a string object with the ICCID number of the SIM card.

#### lte.reset\(\*, reset=True\)

Perform a hardware reset on the cellular modem. This function can take up to 5 seconds to return as it waits for the modem to shutdown and reboot.
Has an optional `reset` parameter to specify if the modem should be reset before switching of the radio. can help in cases where `lte.deattach()` casuses the modem to freeze.

#### lte.pppsuspend\(\)

Pause the Lte ppp connection to allow sending of AT commands


#### lte.pppresume\(\)

Resuime the Lte ppp connection after sending of AT commands
