## Power Consumption

Here are some basic power usage measurements for various scenarios.

* Idle : 36.2mA - Whilst the LO4 is idle. but awake
* Lora transmit : 141mA - Whilst the LO4 is transmitting a Lora Payload
* WiFi AP: 116mA - Whilst the LO4 is serving as a Wifi Access Point
* Wifi client : 110mA - Whilst the LO4 is serving as a Wifi Access Client
* Bluetooth  : 116mA - Whilst the LO4 has bluetooth active  
* DeepSleep : 5.5 uA - Whilst the LO4 is in deepsleep
